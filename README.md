# SmartCare Medical Chatbot

SmartCare is a full-stack AI-powered medical chatbot that provides users with reliable, conversational health information. It integrates modern AI, semantic search, and a sleek interface to deliver an intuitive healthcare experience.

## üéØ Motivation

Healthcare information is often scattered, complex, or inaccessible when needed most. I built SmartCare to provide immediate, understandable health guidance while exploring the intersection of AI and healthcare in a full-stack application.

## üöÄ Potential Impact

SmartCare could improve health literacy, provide 24/7 access to useful medical information, and help users make more informed healthcare decisions. It's designed to supplement professional medical advice, not replace it (see disclaimer below).
